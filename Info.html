          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
            </p>
            <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>

          <h1 class="header">How to prevent infection?</h1>
          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty.</p>
            <p>When coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue â€“ discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.</p>
            <p>Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.</p>
            <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.</p>
